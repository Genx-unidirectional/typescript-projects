### Design patterns.

# Null-Object-Pattern

Assume we have data , info , users which are array of objects , then we perform the function or any operation using those objects but what when that object is null we perform null checks so rather than performing lot's null checks we make similar special null object which behave in a neutral way

In 01nullObjectPattern.ts we can clearly see that we can creative null object and which makes our code cleaner also not error prone and without bugs.

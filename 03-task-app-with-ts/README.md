### Simple task app using typescript

---

### Description of Logic

### Using classes

# Creating lower level class

- ðŸ‘‰ First we made class for making object of item which stores id, item, checked to check whether task is completed or not.

- ðŸ‘‰ Using getter and setter for accessing the props inside class we made and making interface to apply types.

- ðŸ‘‰ We make it singleton because only one instance is required and we manipulate it.

# Class for manipulating the list of items

- ðŸ‘‰ Making class with all list operations on object we made from item class

- ðŸ‘‰ We make it singleton because only one instance is required and we manipulate it.

# Class for making the html template from the classes we made

- ðŸ‘‰ We make class having html ul element in which all operation of adding task is done using all the classes we make for listing.
